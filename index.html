      <h3>I'm a Sydney based, full stack developer.</h3>
      <p>My professional life started in Media and Advertising, working for the
        National Sales team at News Corp. Being new to the 9-5 meant I had a lot
        to learn and the pace of the role meant I had to pick it up quickly. In
        my time there, I worked across both print and digital media, but it
        didn’t take long for me to see my loyalties lay with the digital side of
        things. Two years later, and I made the move to London where I found myself
        lucky enough to be working for General Assembly. For me, GA opened so many
        doors to the tech sector, and most importantly, Web Development. I knew
        I had barely scratched the surface of the “tech industry” so from day one
        at GA, I dabbled in short courses, information sessions and workshops to
        figure out what the fuss was all about. Coding was a foreign concept to me,
        but my natural sense of curiosity meant I was eager to know what the fuss
        was about.</p>

        <p>Development lets me combine my love for creating things and problem solving.
        It’s important to me that I am always kept on my toes with new challenges
        to face.
        </p>

        <p>One thing that’s never changed throughout my life is that I’m always
        happiest and most productive  in a fast paced environment, so I know
        that’s what I need from any future role or employer to really thrive.
        I’ve so far loved working with both front and back end technologies, so
        what’s most important to me for my first role is that I’m challenged and
        given the best opportunity to continue my learning and grow as a developer.

          <h3 class="column">Moodify</h3>
          <p>For our third project, we were split into teams and asked to build
            a fully RESTful, MEAN stack app over the course of a week. After
            deciding to do something out of the ordinary that combined something
            we all loved (not an easy feat) we landed on Moodify. Moodify gives
            users a playlist from spotify depending on their mood. They are able
            to create an account/login (either via spotify or through the app
            directly) and upload a photo of themself via Filestack. It then sends
            this to a third party facial recognition API (Face++) which returns
            data on which emotion is detected at the highest level. Moodify then
            returns a playlist to match that mood such as “Sad Songs”, or “Get
            Home Happy!”. This was my favourite project over the course. I have
            a real affinity for working with third party API’s. There is something
            I love about taking data that is available for me and moulding it to
            do something entirely different and out of the ordinary. This was
            also our first group project which I loved because it’s clear how
            much more you can achieve in a team not just due to man hours but
            also coming down to the support that we gave each other from start to
            end.</p>

        <div class="project">
          <img src="./images/destination_love.png">
          <h3 class="column">Destination Love </h3>
          <p>Our final project brief was much like our previous, however we used
            React for this one rather than Angular, and we had the choice to work
            in groups or on our own. Myself and another friend from class decided
            to work together for a few reasons, namely that we both enjoyed working
            with other people and we knew we could achieve more together than we
            could on our own. I’ll say I was a lot more confident after spending
            more time on it with this project and I knew that would be a huge part
            of my life going forward as a developer. Destination Love is a fully
            RESTful, MERN stack “dating app” which allowed users to match with
            others, message those matched love interests, and, when the time was
            right, plan a date with them. When users decided to plan a date,
            Destination Love would use Google Maps to find the midpoint between
            the two lovers geographical locations, and return a list of bars within
            a 1km radius of that midpoint - essentially removing that “Where should
            we go?” dilemma. This was a really fun project to work on so I’m so
            glad I did it in a group, especially it being the final brief we were
            given. It was also the first project I took on Google Maps - a challenge
            but a very enjoyable one with that.</p>

          <img src="./images/sloth_burger.png">
          <h3 class="column">Sloth Burger</h3>
          <p> Our first project of the course. After tackling HTML, CSS and JavaScript
            for two and a half weeks, we were given the brief for our first project
            which was to build a game using what we had learnt so far. With such a
            wide scope of options I decided to combine two things I love most in
            life - sloths and burgers. The finished product was a collision based
            game which required the player to move the sloth at the bottom of the
            screen to collect burgers and score as many points as they could while
            at the same time avoiding the carrots as they deducted points. I was
            happy with the outcome but having hit MVP earlier than I expected I
            became fixated on having a leaderboard that wouldn’t refresh when the
            page was reloaded. As we hadn’t yet covered server side or databases I
            decided to utilise local storage to store the usernames and scores of
            the players. I really loved this project - not only because it was a
            combination of my two favourite things in life but it was fun and I
            learned so much. There were a lot of challenges I faced but it really
            solidified everything I had learned in the course so far. </p>

        <div class="project">
          <img src="./images/instaspam.png">
          <h3 class="column">InstaSpam</h3>
          <p>This was our first look into Full Stack Develoment and what really
            piqued my interest in server side technologies. The finished product
            was a fully RESTful web application in which users could securely
            create an account and login, then upload, view, edit, delete and
            comment on pictures that had been uploaded. The name came from the
            idea that all the content would be inspired by “Spam” the canned meat,
            and was a parody version of the instagram account. Interacting with
            the server side in this project was something I really enjoyed as well
            as the authentication side of things.</p>
