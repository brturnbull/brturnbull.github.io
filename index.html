      <h3>I'm a Sydney based, full stack developer.</h3>
      <p>My professional life started in Media and Advertising, working for the
        National Sales team at News Corp. Being new to the 9-5 meant I had a lot
        to learn and the pace of the role meant I had to pick it up quickly. In
        my time there, I worked across both print and digital media, but it
        didn’t take long for me to see my loyalties lay with the digital side of
        things. Two years later, and I made the move to London where I found myself
        lucky enough to be working for General Assembly. For me, GA opened so many
        doors to the tech sector, and most importantly, Web Development. I knew
        I had barely scratched the surface of the “tech industry” so from day one
        at GA, I dabbled in short courses, information sessions and workshops to
        figure out what the fuss was all about. Coding was a foreign concept to me,
        but my natural sense of curiosity meant I was eager to know what the fuss
        was about.</p>

        <p>Development lets me combine my love for creating things and problem solving.
        It’s important to me that I am always kept on my toes with new challenges
        to face.
        </p>

        <p>One thing that’s never changed throughout my life is that I’m always
        happiest and most productive  in a fast paced environment, so I know
        that’s what I need from any future role or employer to really thrive.
        I’ve so far loved working with both front and back end technologies, so
        what’s most important to me for my first role is that I’m challenged and
        given the best opportunity to continue my learning and grow as a developer.
      </p>

          <p>My first project - a collision based game which requires the player to move the sloth at the bottom of the screen to collect burgers and score as many points as they could while at the same time avoiding the carrots as they deducted points. As we hadn’t yet covered server side or databases I decided to utilise local storage to store the usernames and scores of the players. </p>
